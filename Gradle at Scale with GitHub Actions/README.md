# Gradle at scale with GitHub and GitHub Actions at Allegro

https://www.youtube.com/live/gV94I28FPos

## Abstract
We continue the series of Gradle Build Tool end-user huddles! On July 2nd, noon UTC. Let's see how our friends at Allegro utilize the GitHub Actions to develop and maintain Gradle projects at scale.

Allegro is one of Poland's most popular shopping platforms and one of the largest e-commerce platforms of European origin. They have 10,000+ repositories on GitHub, and that’s quite a scale to manage! The team uses the setup-gradle action to maintain a global, centralized Gradle configuration for a great developer experience for their product teams. Also, they’re enabling the new Dependency Submission Action for GitHub across their repositories.

During this online huddle, we will discuss GitHub specifics for Gradle projects, automation with GitHub Actions and shared configurations, and security aspects of dependency management with Gradle, Dependabot, and GitHub Security. We will focus on the live demos and Q&A with the audience.
